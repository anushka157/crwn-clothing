#Problem: Minimum Cost Hamiltonian Path (Graph + DP + Bitmask)
#Description

#Given a directed weighted graph, find the minimum cost Hamiltonian path (visiting every vertex exactly once) without returning to the start.

#Variant of TSP, but no need to return to starting node

#Solved using DP + Bitmask in O(nÂ² * 2^n)

#Useful in logistics, robotics path planning, task scheduling

    dp = [[float('inf')]*n for _ in range(1<<n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[1<<i][i] = 0  # start at each node

    for mask in range(1<<n):
        for u in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1<<u)):
                continue
